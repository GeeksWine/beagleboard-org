This project is called BeagleBoard.org and was built for the purpose of hosting
http://BeagleBoard.org and evolving into a method for aggregating project
activities useful for other open source projects.  The problem to ultimately
address is the need of watching lots of projects related to one project, but
not get overwhelmed by unrelated project information. At some point, this
project may be renamed to jMCML or j1950 or something else that gives it
meaning beyone BeagleBoard.org.

The source can be cloned at http://www.beagleboad.org/beagleboard.org.git/.  It
is also mirrored on git://repo.or.cz/beagleboard.org.git.
