    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Where is BeagleBoard.org headed?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is to improve access to technology that can be helpful in
    solving problems---global problems, local problems, educational problems and
    everyday problems of efficiency that prevent people from contributing more
    of their time and effort in more productive endeavors. The fundamental
    question is, what
    are the most critical problems an organization like BeagleBoard.org
    can be involved in solving?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you aren&apos;t aware, the
    BeagleBoard.org Foundation is a 501(c) non-profit US-based corporation, yet
    there are obvious ties to the for-profit companies Texas Instruments, who
    pays my salary and produces the processors we use for the board designs, and
    CircuitCo Electronics, who buys all the components, assembles the boards and
    ships those boards to distributors around the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What have I learned?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The everyday second grader and everyday electronics design engineer certainly
    have different care abouts, but they are also remarkably similar. Beyond
    the obvious need for a nap in the afternoon that they feel they&apos;ve outgrown,
    they are also both plagued by incredibly short attention spans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation wins. I don&apos;t necessarily mean that those people who are the
    most innovative win, but rather that innovation itself drives change and
    new innovations spread through the world if we like them or not. It then
    becomes a requirement that if we want positive change for the world, we
    must be involved in innovations that produce positive results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation doesn&apos;t always come in the form of an improved product.
    Sometimes innovation can be as simple as providing a better description
    of how to use an existing product, providing a better way of building a
    product or even have nothing to do with a product at all.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborative&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>
