 &lt;h1&gt;Is BeagleBoard.org Linux only?&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Beagle Board as such is not associated to Linux only.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;BeagleBoard.org gives links and pointers (including source) for data related to Beagle. If some one has done an excellent work on Beagle with a propriety OS, we will give links to his site from beagleboard.org, it’s left to him if he wants to open his source or not.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;You will be able to download Linux and Booting S/W directly from the site.  The discussion forums will be organic, growing out of whatever projects are started, not centrally controlled and categorized.  We will educate people how to start their own forums and we will provide a central repository of projects on-going and aggregate news from those projects ala http://planet.maemo.org and others.  The task of the site will to be generate awareness of the projects.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;What software can be downloaded directly from BeagleBoard.org?&lt;/h1&gt;
