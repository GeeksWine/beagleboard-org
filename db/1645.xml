 &lt;h2&gt;What is the BeagleBoard Bone?&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The BeagleBoard Bone is the low-cost, high-expansion hardware-hacker focused BeagleBoard.  It is a bare-bones BeagleBoard that acts as a USB or Ethernet connected expansion companion for your current BeagleBoard and BeagleBoard-xM or works stand-alone.  It is small!  With the high-performance ARM capabilities you expect from a BeagleBoard, the BeagleBoard Bone&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for the future of the BeagleBoard and the BeagleBoard-xM?&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The BeagleBoard and BeagleBoard-xM will continue to be manufactured and available for purchase for several years to come (no end of life in sight).  We can be confident of this thanks to TI&apos;s commitment to having parts availability for 10+ years for the key components.  There have been instances where we&apos;ve needed to update non-TI components on the BeagleBoard, such as the recent upgrade from 256MB of NAND flash on the BeagleBoard to 512MB due to the end-of-life of the memory device.  We believe the upgrade shows our commitment to continued production and support of the existing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;When will the BeagleBoard Bone be available?&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This depends on a lot of factors, but it is expected to be broadly available in the fourth quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Some early samples will be provided to active community members in exchange for improving the software base or available expansion boards for the entire community.  If you believe this applies to you, please contact jkridner on http://beagleboard.org/chat for approval and provide your contact information on http://tinyurl.com/givebb.  Do not private message me on IRC.  Simply include &apos;jkridner&apos; in your comment on the channel.  Also, this will be a pre-release version, so you are still expected to order a final version when it becomes available to ensure compatibility with your product.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;How much will the BeagleBoard Bone cost?&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This has not been announced yet and is up to distributors.  The suggested retail price will be below the $149 suggested retail price of the BeagleBoard-xM and the $125 suggested retail price of the BeagleBoard.&lt;/p&gt;
