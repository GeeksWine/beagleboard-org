 &lt;h1&gt;About BeagleBoard.org&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;BeagleBoard.org is an all volunteer activity started-up by a collection of passionate individuals, including several employees of Texas Instruments, interested in creating powerful, open, and embedded devices. We invite you to participate and become part of BeagleBoard.org, defining its direction.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Support for the BeagleBoard comes from the very active development community through this website, the mailing list, and the IRC channel. Original production funding was provided by Digi-Key, a major international distributor, but distribution has now been opened up to several distributors across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The BeagleBoard is a low-cost, fan-less single-board computer based on low-power Texas Instruments processors featuring the ARM Cortex-A series core with all of the expandability of today&apos;s desktop machines, but without the bulk, expense, or noise.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  For some additional background, you can look at
  &lt;a href=&quot;/brief&quot;&gt;the Beagle Board brief.&lt;/a&gt;
