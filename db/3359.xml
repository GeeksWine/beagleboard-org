    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;by Jason Kridner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are, 2014. Expect a big year for Beagle! Unfortunately, I have to
    start out with an apology. &lt;a href=&quot;http://linuxgizmos.com/beaglebone-black-sbc-surpasses-100000-units/&quot;&gt;
        LinuxGizmos.com
    &lt;/a&gt;
    recently hopped on the news that over 100,000 BeagleBone Blacks have now
    been sold. When they contacted me to confirm, I blundered a bit by repeating
    and confirming what I thought was a fairly broadly shared rumor---that we
    are looking to soon shift the Linux distribution that ships in the flash of
    the boards from Angstrom to Debian. The blunder wasn&apos;t the confirming of the
    news, but rather not doing a good job at communicating to the community
    about this move better ahead of time. It didn&apos;t help that I was taking off
    for vacation where my Internet access is spotty at best. So, I owe you all
    a big apology, but I hope you are still excited about the news.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what&apos;s coming?&lt;/h2&gt;
