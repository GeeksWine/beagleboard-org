    <body>&lt;h1&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;by Jason Kridner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are, 2014. Expect a big year for Beagle! Unfortunately, I have to
    start out with an apology. &lt;a href=&quot;http://linuxgizmos.com/beaglebone-black-sbc-surpasses-100000-units/&quot;&gt;
        LinuxGizmos.com
    &lt;/a&gt;
    recently hopped on the news that over 100,000 BeagleBone Blacks have now
    been sold. When they contacted me to confirm, I blundered a bit by repeating
    and confirming what I thought was a fairly broadly shared rumor---that we
    are looking to soon shift the Linux distribution that ships in the flash of
    the boards from Angstrom to Debian. The blunder wasn&apos;t the confirming of the
    news, but rather not doing a good job at communicating to the community
    about this move better ahead of time. It didn&apos;t help that I was taking off
    for vacation where my Internet access is spotty at best. So, I owe you all
    a big apology, but I hope you are still excited about the news.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what&apos;s coming?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big news is a shift to Debian in the on-board flash. You&apos;ll still be
    able to flash Angstrom if you want to use that and myself and others in the
    community will still be rather happy to help you with Angstrom-related
    questions, but the feeling is that we&apos;ll get a much broader support base
    if we have new users encounter Debian first on the upcoming boards.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The exact date of the switch-over hasn&apos;t been determined. Gerald had most
    recently given me and everyone involved a deadline of giving him an image
    by the end of January, but we are currently bottlenecked by the updated
    version of Cloud9 IDE. I have been playing with a beta of version 3 and I
    find it to be a huge improvement that will enable us to provide support for
    C compilation within the IDE using plug-ins. The new version also runs on
    node 0.10, making it much easier to work with recent Debian builds. Before
    any switch in production happens, there will be a fairly complete beta image
    shared broadly for testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How similar will the experience be?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    If you aren&apos;t a heavy Linux user and just do a few things from the command-line
    and use the Cloud9 IDE, the experience will be pretty similar, but I hope
    you&apos;ll find it somewhat improved. If you are a more seasoned developer, I
    probably don&apos;t need to answer the question, because you are already likely to
    be somewhat experienced with Debian. All of the key features you expect
    should be there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We have a handful of performance goals to try to keep the experience on-par
    with Angstrom. One is a boot time target of under 10 seconds. Using the
    typical boot strategy for Debian Wheezy without any significant optimization,
    Robert Nelson observed that boot time was more like 30 seconds. By switching
    over to systemd, as is used by typical Angstrom builds, boot time dropped to
    around 16 seconds. We&apos;ll be spending a bit of time trying to improve this
    between now and the beta image.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Space on the flash will likely be very similar, due to trying to provide
    similar functionality. The builds are currently quite a bit smaller, but
    Robert is still adding in items to bring in feature parity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jadonk/bonescript&quot;&gt;
        BoneScript
    &lt;/a&gt;
    will still be included in the out-of-box experience to help
    quickly prove out the various hardware interfaces and help people learn
    about wiring up hardware. I&apos;ve fixed most of the issues with getting BoneScript
    onto other distros besides Angstrom and am planning to soon release version
    0.2.4 that already has improved support for switching pin modes and reading
    pin states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Over time, there will be more promotion of the
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://elinux.org/Userspace_Arduino&quot;&gt;Userspace Arduino project&lt;/a&gt;
    that provides an easy-to-learn C API for rapid prototyping of hardware
    projects. Of course, the boards will continue to ship with a C/C++ compiler
    and build tools and a number of interpreters. I&apos;ve also been chatting
    quite a few times with the Erlang folks, so that is something that has a
    good likelihood of being included.
&lt;/p&gt;
