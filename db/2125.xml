    <body>This project consists of the development of a software library for the beaglebone and a beaglebone cape.  The first part of the software development is to create  a set of libraries to perform basic movement commands for steppers, servos, and DC motors.  Once these libraries are developed an additional set of libraries will be developed for G-Code CNC control, 3D printing, and robotics armatures.

The development of the cape will be a flexible cape that can use the same GPIO pins for servos, stepper, and DC motors.  The specific function will be determined by the user with the use of the libraries.  

For questions, comments, requests, or participation please contact us.
