    <body>The System will use any video camera attache to our beagle board, once the process of image retrieval is over the processing takes place, once the fire is detected the information is sent to control center using USB or Zigbee Protocol, this method have advantages over smoke based fire prediction systems because here we are not predicting rather detecting, there by giving 100% correct info to the responsible persons to take action.</body>

    <shortdesc>The fire detection systems available today use smoke sensors to predict fire rather than to detect, in this project a video based fire detection will take palce controlled by beagle board.The system will use either USB or Zigbee protocol to communicate with the control center and also will have a alarm unit, the most difficult task will be Image Processing Algorithms to detect fire. </shortdesc>
