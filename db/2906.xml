    <body>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this project is to build a solar energy powered cell phone controlled car. Resistive matching has been employed to extract maximum energy from a solar panel, with minimal complications. This is done in order to maximize the amount of energy that is transferred from the solar cell into a Li-ion battery. This battery is used to drive an H-bridge motor controller which is controlled through the BeagleBone. The BeagleBone communicates with a smartphone app via serial bluetooth communication which allows the user to control the car using the any android device.&lt;/p&gt;</body>
