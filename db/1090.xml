    <body>This project I am taking or wanted to do because I wanted to replace all the papers consumption which will save our trees and also to save power where the device will last for atleast 7 days once charged. Further also have plan to get charged by solar energy.
                 To get the touch of the paper I am using E-ink. I need to port the E-ink with a beagle board. Since I am Using E-ink power will last long in the device.
        This project is to save EARTH and GO GREEN</body>
