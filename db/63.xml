 &lt;h1&gt;About BeagleBoard.org&lt;/h1&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;BeagleBoard.org is an all volunteer activity started-up by a collection of Texas Instruments (TI) engineers as what is called a &quot;small dreams&quot; project.  &quot;Small dreams&quot; is an initiative at TI where employees with good ideas that don&apos;t necessarily require a large team are given a bit of funding to pursue their idea, in this case having a board fabricated and getting hosting for a website.  The Beagle Board project is, however, not meant to be a Texas Instruments project.  Instead, we welcome those who are interested in powerful, open, and embedded devices to participate and become part of BeagleBoard.org, defining its direction.&lt;/p&gt;
