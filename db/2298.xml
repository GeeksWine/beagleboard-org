    <pname>Low End Mother Board Design</pname>
    <user>vkadal@gmail.com</user>
    <body>Day by day, the processor capability keeps increasing.  So it is possible to design a low end mother board for desktop / laptop application without intel / amd processors.  With rapid advancement in solid state drives (SSD) the hard disk can be eliminated. This mother board can be easily used to do simple work like word processing, spread sheet, email clients, browsing and chat. The total power consumption for this mother board shall be less than 25W (It can be even smaller) . If possible, it shall have an interface to TV. An USB port can be provided to connect external hard disk. And another USB port to connect mouse / key board. This type of products will be usefull in schools, educational institutes, libraries etc where the limited performance will do. If this device becomes popular MW of power can be saved.

I am looking for a team of engineers who support this idea. If complete schematics, gerbers can be created, it can be posted in open domain so that anybody can take up manufacturing. This will be an open source hardware. Let me know your views
