    <body>Micrel will provide KSZ8851SNL eval board and instructions on simple connection to Beagle
Board.  Basic Linux drivers are already developed, UBoot could also be a sideline of this project.  Main goal is to show that when you hook this to your PC and type &amp;quot;192.168.1.1&amp;quot; that a web
page is served... and would like to view the live video provided by a USB camera.  Ultimate goal would be to code in a static IP address and show that this board could sit anywhere in the world and provide monitoring via Internet connection.</body>
